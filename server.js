// MEDIUM: Create a JSON file that will have 10 employees in it, their employeeID, their name, their salary and department name.
// Then, create an express API so that when you hit the endpoint with a GET request we want the api to respond with all data on the employees.
// If you hit the endpoint with their employeeID, we want to hand up only the information on that one employee.
// If you hit the endpoint with an incorrect employeeID, send back the correct HTTP status code and an error message stating that the employee was not found.
